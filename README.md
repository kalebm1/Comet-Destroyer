# COMET DESTROYER BROWSER GAME

This is my GitHub Repository for my COMET DESTROYER, a project developed for a class at LSU.

It is still a Beta game, so there are a lot of bugs and kinks to work out. But enjoy!

## What have I added?

I recently added integration with a NeDB database by setting up a Node.js server to interact with the database.
I setup an api route to be able to Get and Post data with the database. Because of this, I was able to add a leaderboard
feature for the game that dynamically shows leaderboard data from the end screen where you can add your name if you
would like.

## TODO:
